PROBLEM
==========
We want you to write a small application that uses data contained in
the `data` directory to answer the following questions:

1. In total, how many pounds have these athletes Bench Pressed?
   Within a given set, reps * weight = total weight
   Ex: 5 reps * 100 pounds = 500 pounds total weight
2. How many pounds did Barry Moore Back Squat in 2016?
3. In what month of 2017 did Barry Moore Back Squat the most total weight?
4. What is Abby Smith's Bench Press PR weight?
   PR defined as the most the person has ever lifted for that exercise,
   regardless of reps performed.


OUTPUT
==========
Your code should output a JSON object with the questions above answered.


STANDARDS FOR QUALITY
==========
Your code test submission will be reviewed by our entire engineering team
and we thrive on quality. At a minimum, we expect your submission to include:
* Correct answers to each question
* High readability
* Consistent formatting with a high level of attention to detail
* Well named variables, functions, classes, directories, and files
* Clean separation of concerns
* Automated testing
* Concern for reusability and deduplication

The most common way to fail our code test is to write a procedural program
that only directly answers the provided questions. While this approach
may be fast to develop and does demonstrate basic programming capability,
it rarely reflects a production quality implementation.


SUBMISSION
==========
If you have any questions on the code or what is being asked,
please don't hesitate to email.

Please submit your completed test as a zip file,
private dropbox or private file sharing link, or using a private repo.
